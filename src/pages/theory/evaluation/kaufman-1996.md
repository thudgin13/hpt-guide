### Brief Description
Kaufman-Keller-Watkins recognized that the Kirkpatrick Model of Training Evaluation wasn't robust enough for all learnign evaluation and offered an exanded version of 5 levels.

### Details

Input (Level 1a): This level focuses on the resources and materials used in the intervention. It assesses the quality, availability, and accessibility of these resources. For example, are the training materials well-designed, up-to-date, and relevant to the learners?

Process (Level 1b): This level evaluates the actual delivery and implementation of the intervention. It looks at factors like the quality of instruction, the learning environment, and the efficiency of the delivery process. For example, was the training delivered effectively? Were the learners engaged and satisfied with the process?

Acquisition (Level 2): This level measures what learners have gained from the intervention. It assesses whether they have acquired new knowledge, skills, or attitudes. This is similar to Kirkpatrick's Level 2 (Learning). For example, did the learners achieve the learning objectives? Can they demonstrate new skills or knowledge?

Application (Level 3): This level evaluates how well learners are able to apply what they have learned in the real world, typically in their jobs. It assesses whether the intervention has led to changes in behavior or performance. This is similar to Kirkpatrick's Level 3 (Behavior). For example, are learners using their new skills on the job? Has their performance improved as a result of the training?

Organizational Payoffs (Level 4): This level measures the impact of the intervention on the organization as a whole. It assesses whether the intervention has led to improvements in organizational outcomes, such as increased productivity, reduced costs, or improved customer satisfaction. This is similar to Kirkpatrick's Level 4 (Results). For example, has the training program led to a reduction in employee errors? Has it increased sales or improved customer retention?

Societal Outcomes (Level 5): This level, which is unique to Kaufman's model, looks at the broader impact of the intervention on society or the organization's clients. It assesses whether the intervention has contributed to positive changes in areas like public health, safety, or environmental sustainability. For example, has a public awareness campaign led to a decrease in smoking rates? Has a new product improved the lives of customers?
