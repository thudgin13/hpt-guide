### Brief Description
John Keller, a psychologist, draws on ideas from expectancy theory and self-determination models. It provides four steps to ensure that learners remain motivated throughout the experience: Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Sastisfaction

### Details
1. Attention - capturing and holding your learner's attention
    Keller suggests you can gain attention in two ways:
    - *Perceptual arousal* creating curiosity in the learner by using surprise or uncertainty
    - *Inquriy arousal* using interested or challenging questions 
2. Relevance
    - Demonstrate the importance or utility of the learning material
    - Address learners needs and goals
3. Confidence
    - Build a learner's *self-efficacy* or the believe that they will be able to achieve the learning objectives
    - If a learner believes they can succeed they are more likely to put in the effort needed to learn
    - Provide specific feedback throughout the learning 
4. Satisfaction
    - Provide learners with a sense of accomplishment or reward
    - Learners who feel satisfied with their current level of progress are more likely to stay motivated and persist
