### Brief Description
Nick Pelling is a game designer from the UK who coined the term "gamification" when he was tasked with making a game like interface for ATMs and vending machines. At its core, it takes elements of game play (points, badges, levels, challenges, etc.) and integrates them into non-gaming environments.
### Details
Gamification has been evident throughout time as tool for learning. Some of the earlier examples are badges for girl scout and boy scout troops. However, much of gamifcation in education is based on the foundational work was Thomas Malone's Study on why games and gaming makes it fun to learn. The idea it to keep users more engaged and create a product users see as fun.
