### Brief Description
The Diffusion of Innovations Model, developedby Everett Rogers, explains how new technology and ideas are spread through a population.
### Details
1. Innovators - First to adopt a technology and are often seen as risk-takers as they don't need social proof to try a new idea or technology (Roughly 2.5%)
2. Early Adopters - Trend leaders but follow after the innovators. These people have a high degree of influence in their social netowrk (Roughly 13.5%)
3. Early Majority - More risk-adverse and look for social validation and evidence of success prior to trying a new idea or technology (roughly 34%)
4. Late Majority - Arrive after the majority of the population has started on a trend. (roughly 34%).
5. Laggards - Last to join and usually join the trend just before it is going to reverse (roughly 16%)
