    alt: 'he UTAUT model uses four core determinants to determine users behavioral intention (BI) to use a technology: Performance expectancy (PE), e ff ort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions (FC) (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use are moderating variables assumed to influence the four key variables on usage intention and behavior.'

### Brief Description
UTAUT was developed by Venketesh et al. in 2003 to explain the factors that influence a user's liklihood to use a new technology. The effect of predictors is moderated by demographic information like age, gender, etc. 
### Details
This theory is based on four key constructs that influence user behavior:
1. Performance Expectancy
1. Effort Expetency
1. Social Influence
1. Facilitating Conditions

This theory has since been expanded to the UTAUT2 that offers more complexity and factors that can influence a user's liklehood like price and perceived enjoyment/
