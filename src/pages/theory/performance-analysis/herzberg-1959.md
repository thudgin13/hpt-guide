## Details
Herzberg's Two-Factory Theory is also known as motivation-hygiene theory. This theory is based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and suggests that work satisfaction is not a spectrum. Herzberg sees work satisfactiona and dissastisfaction that are impacted separately by different facators.
### Brief Description
 The Two Factors:
 1. Hygiene Factors - Basic needs and elements of the job itself
  Examples Include: salary, relationships, company policies, supervision, etc. 
  Impact: when hygiene factors are poor, they impact job disastisfaction. When they are good, they don't necesssairily impact job satisfaction
 2. Motivators - Directly related to the work and drive motivation
    Examples: achievement, recognition, responsibility, opportunities for advancement
    Impact: When they are present, job satisfaction increases but may not decrease when they are absent

    Limitation: This is not a one-size fits all approach. What is motivating to one person will be different than another.
