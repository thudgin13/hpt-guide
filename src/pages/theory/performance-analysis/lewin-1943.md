### Brief Description
 Kurt Lewin, a social psychologist, designed Force Field Analysis as part of his larger change management framework. This is a visualization of forces that are driving toward the desired state or change and the restraining forces that serve as obstacles.

 ### Details

 Lewin suggests that the status quo or the rational for why the change does not occur is due to an equilibrium between restraining and driving forces. In order for the desired state or change to occur, you need to increase driving forces or decrease restraining forces, or both! 

 Process
 1. Define the change or goal
 2. Brainstorm a list of all the forces that impact or influence this change
 3. Analyze the forces by assessing the strength of each force. In the diagram above it is a 1-4 scale, but it could alos be assessed as strong, medium or weak.
 4. Plot the forces on the chart in relative comparison to the other forces. The length of the arrow will indicate the strength of the force. In the diagram above, 4 would be the strongest forces.
 5. Develop a strategy - Come up with a plan for how to either increase or decrease the plotted forces.
