### Brief Description
 BJ Fogg developed this theory at the Stanford Design Lab. It can be summarized as **B=MAP** B is the desired behavior and there needs to be a convergence of M for motivation, A for ability and P for prompt. Without any of these 3 elements, the model suggests the behavior will not occur.

### Details
The three componenets that lead to behavior change:

1. Motivation - The desire or drive to do the behavior
    - Three core motivators: Sensation (pleasure vs pain), Anticipation (hope or fear), Belonging (social acceptance vs rejection)
    - A person's motivation can vary from high to low depending on the level of difficulty of the task
2. Ability  - Ease or diffculty of perfroming the task
    - Six factors that influence ability: time, money, physical ability, brain cycles, social deviance and non-routine
3. Prompt - The rigger or cue to the desired behavior
    - A prompt can be text or verbal reminder
    - Without a cue it does not matter if the person has desire or ability to execute the desired behavior
    - Three types of prompts: facilitator (high motivation but low ability), spark (high ability or low motivation), signal (high motivation and high ability)
