## Details
Rothwell developed this diagram for the HPT Model. These six cells are formed from two rows, which correlate to present gaps and future gaps. Each row categorizes these gaps as "positive gaps" that have exceeded the desired state, "neutral gaps" where the actual performance is the same as desired, and "negative gaps" where the actual performance is below the desired gap
### Brief Description
Important to note: it is suggested that neutral gaps have the potential for the biggest impact because the competitors are not focused on those gaps as they are seen as "neutral"
