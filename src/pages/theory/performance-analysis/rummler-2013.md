### Brief Description
Rummler and Brache believe that better processes are the key to improving performance and work and worker level. 

### More Details
They recommend mapping out how a process flows through an organization and across teams to evaluate different breakpoints and handoff. It should start with the supplier and end when it reaches the customer. Their book's title focuses on the blank spaces between where work moves through the process and between people where managers can be most effective.
