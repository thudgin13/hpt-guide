## Details

Often referred to as a Front End Analysis these questions provide a guide to systematic guide to get into gaps and potentially their root cause

### Brief Description
Identifying the Performance Analysis:

1. Do we have a probelm?
2. Is it a performance problem?
3. How will we know when the problem is solved?
4. What is the performance problem?
5. Should we allocate resources to solve the problem?

Analyzing the Cause:

6. What are the possible causes?
7. What evidence do you have for each possibility?
8. What is the probable cause?

Considering Solutions:
9.  What general solution type is indicated?
10. What are the alternate subtypes of the solution?
11. What are the cost, effect of each solution?
12. What are the constraints?
13. What are the overall goals?
