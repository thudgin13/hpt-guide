### Brief Description
 John Sweller's (1988) Cognitive Load Theory is based on the assumption that our brain has a limited working memory. He identifies intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load that contribute to overall learning.

### Details

**Extraneous Cognitive Load**
This refers to anything in the learning expereince that is not directly focused on acquiring learning elements. This could be irrelevant information or a poorly designed chart.

**Intrinsic Cognitive Load**
This refers to the complexity of the tasks and interactivity among the elements in conjunction with a learner's prior knowledge. 

For example: learning how to subtract after knowing how to count and basic addition, will have a lower cognitive load than teaching numbers and counting to learners hearing them for the first time.

**Germane Cognitive Load**
This differs from the previous two types as it is a byproduct of the working memory in action. This refers to the cogntiive effort rquired for the learning task. It's the process of taking the new information and rooting it to a prior schema to be able to be stored in the long term memory.
