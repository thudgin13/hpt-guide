### Brief Description
 Presented as an alternative to the ADDIE model more suited to AGILE environments. It is highly collaborative, flexible, fast-paces and iterative.

### Details
The SAM Model consists of three distinct phases
1. Preparation Phase
    - The gathering information phase about the learners and hte projects
    - Tools: interviews, surveys, learning outcomes, gathering existing resources and materials
2. Interative Design Phase
    - Always begins with the signature "Savvy Start." This includes all members involved learning designers, graphid designers, SMEs, learners, etc. for a brainstorming sesson to product 3 rough prototypes
    - Review -> Design -> Prototype to continue building out prototypes, gather feedback and continue interating
3. Iterative Development Phase
    - SAM breaks phases of solutions into three: Alpha, Beta, and Gold. Alpha (similar to MVP) and Gold being the final solution
    - This is also an iterative process getting feedback and making improvements. This can also circle back into the previous phase if necessary. At the end of this process there may not be just one ALpha, Beta and Gold iterations of the product.
