### Brief Description
 Mayer's Multimedia Theory built on the work of Paivio's Dual Coding Theory that we process information differently when its spoken vs visual. By following these principles, instructional designers will create learnign experiences that promote deeper levels of understanding.

### Details
14 Key Principles:

1. Multimedia Principle: People learn better from words and pictures than from words alone.   
2. Contiguity Principle: Words and corresponding pictures should be presented close together in space and time.   
3. Modality Principle: Present words as spoken narration rather than on-screen text.
4. Redundancy Principle: Avoid presenting the same information in both spoken and printed words.   
5. Coherence Principle: People learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included.   
6. Signaling Principle: People learn better when cues are added to highlight the organization of essential material.   
7. Segmenting Principle: People learn better when a multimedia lesson is presented in learner-paced segments rather than as a continuous unit.   
8. Pretraining Principle: People learn better from a multimedia lesson when they know the names and characteristics of the main concepts beforehand.   
9. Personalization Principle: People learn better from multimedia lessons when words are in conversational style rather than formal style.   
10. Voice Principle: People learn better when the narration in multimedia lessons is spoken in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice.   
11. Image Principle: People do not necessarily learn better from a multimedia lesson when the speaker's image is added to the screen.   
12. Temporal Contiguity Principle: People learn better when corresponding graphics and narration are presented simultaneously rather than successively.
