### Brief Description
 Davachi et al. created the AGES model while working at the NeuroLeadership Institute. They sought to better align learnign design with the neuroscience research

### Details
1. A - Attention 
    - The goal of learning design needs to be trigger active & voluntary learning in the brain. 
    - Keep instruction in short (less than 20min chunks) and ensure multitasking is not occurring
1. G - Generation (of connections)
    - As the brain stores information in a web-like system of interconnected info, it is essential to generate connections between new and existing information
    - Offer reflection opportunties and social connection to discuss concepts. This also will allow learners to have a more nuanced perspective.
1. E - Emotion
    - "Engage the brain through the heart"
    - Challenges traditional notion that emotion and logic should remain separate. Retention is often increased when strong emotion is included in the learning
1. S - Space
    - People remember best when learning is spread out over time.
    - The best design is allowing time for sleep before other sessions, but suggest that groups do better when even small gaps are available between learning sessions
    - Learners should re-engage with concepts at least 3 times for best retention
