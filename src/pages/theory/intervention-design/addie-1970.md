### Brief Description
 "ADDIE model stands for Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate"

### Details

The origins of the ADDIE model are unclear and it's more accurate to suggest that they emerged as Instructional Design developed as a field. It's earliest influences are from the US Airforce's research centeres that were established post World War II. 

It formalized as a theory in the 1970s at Florida State University. It formalized a process and gave instructors a framework to better craft their instruction. It also gave rise to the process of *rapid-prototyping* which allows instructional designers to integrate feedback in earlier stages of developement to better meet learners needs and an improved final product.
